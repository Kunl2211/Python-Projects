Hello Mates,

Before Executing the code , please check the attached images for the positioning of the Tabs and icon.
In my case , I have put the whatsapp tab in the first place and then the gpt tab.

You can customize the position with the given cursor position file to get the coordinates of your mouse click.

You have to setup the GPT too, Ask GPT to give response for the chat provided without any name or timestamp so you can directly copy it.
